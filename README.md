# TS | Todo List

A todo list using JS, React, Typescript & Storybook.

## Consideration

Hello! This repository is just a part of  my study about some good technologies that I was applied in my projects. Please, sorry for some errors, how I said, is just to study and I'll go to make this better, while I'll growing up in my studies. Thanks for your visit and enjoy the adventure! 😉

## How it works?

It's very simple! Just input your todo on the field and press enter. Automatically, your todo will be inserted in a list, above the field. If you want, it's possible to remove the todo just clicking in trash icon, right side of the created todo.

## Important to know!

The data is not being saved to a database or local storage. Because the purpose of this repository is just to show a little about these technologies, not create a new applied js framework. 

## Built With

* [JavaScript](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - The programming language 🌞
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The better JavaScript library 🙈💘
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types to the language 🔒
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Code linter 🕵‍♀
* [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.1.1) - CSS with JavaScript 💎

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
The default module is `esnext`, necessary to run the project. But, to run the tests with success, you need to change something in the tsconfig.json:

```
"module": "commonjs"
```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
